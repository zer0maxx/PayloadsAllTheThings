## Azure Pipelines

The configuration files for azure pipelines are normally located in the root directory of the repository and called - `azure-pipelines.yml`\
You can tell if the pipeline builds pull requests based on its trigger instructions. Look for `pr:` instruction:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
      include:
      - master
      - refs/tags/*
pr:
- master
```
